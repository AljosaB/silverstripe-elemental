# Using block history

## Finding historic versions of content

Whenever you modify a block and save it, a new version of the block is created and the old version is saved in a
history archive. You can view the archived item by navigating to the **History** tab of any block, which will show you a list of each version, the date it was modified or published and the user who actioned the change.

You can select a specific version to see a reference of what the content block looked like at that version.

## Rolling back to specific versions

If you want to revert a content block back to an old version, simply choose the version you want from the list and click the button ***Revert to this version***.

This will create a new draft version of the content block with the old content present. You will need to publish the content block in order to be visible on the front-end website.
